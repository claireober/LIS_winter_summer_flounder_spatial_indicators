# Spatial Indicator Analysis – Long Island Sound

This repository contains R code supporting the manuscript: "Evaluating spatial and temporal dynamics of cold- and warm-adapted fish in a changing Long Island Sound"

## Data access
The trawl survey data are owned by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CT DEEP) and are not publicly available. Researchers must request permission directly from CT DEEP Marine Fisheries.

## Workflow
Scripts are organized in the order they should be run:

1. 01_prepare_data.R – cleaning and formatting survey data
2. 02_spatial_indicators.R – calculation of CG, inertia, positive area, evenness
3. 03_changepoint_analysis.R – BCP and PELT detection
4. 04_make_figures.R – generation of manuscript figures
